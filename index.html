<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>PAIN/INFLAMMATION</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When people have inflammation, it often hurts. They will feel pain, stiffness, discomfort, distress, and even agony, depending on the severity of the inflammation. The type of pain varies. It can be described as constant and steady, throbbing and pulsating, stabbing, or pinching.
    <br>
    <br> Inflammation primarily causes pain because the swelling pushes against the sensitive nerve endings. This sends pain signals to the brain. Other biochemical processes also occur during inflammation. They affect how nerves behave, and this can enhance pain.

      <br><p class="p2">ANXIETY
    </strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When an individual faces potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival. Since the earliest days of humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger sets off alarms in the body and allows evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings.
    <br>
    <br> The danger causes a rush of adrenalin, a hormone and chemical messenger in the brain, which in turn triggers these anxious reactions in a process called the "fight-or-flight' response. This prepares humans to physically confront or flee any potential threats to safety.
    <br>
    <br> For many people, running from larger animals and imminent danger is a less pressing concern than it would have been for early humans. Anxieties now revolve around work, money, family life, health, and other crucial issues that demand a person's attention without necessarily requiring the 'fight-or-flight' reaction.
    <br>
    <br>&nbsp;The causes of anxiety disorders are complicated. Many might occur at once, some may lead to others, and some might not lead to an anxiety disorder unless another is present.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>INSOMNIA</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Insomnia is a sleep disorder that regularly affects millions of people worldwide. In short, individuals with insomnia find it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. The effects can be devastating and commonly leads to daytime sleepiness, lethargy, and a general feeling of being unwell, both mentally and physically. Mood swings, irritability, and 
    <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/anxiety/"><span class="s4">anxiety</span></a> are common associated symptoms.
    <br>
    <br> Insomnia has also been associated with a 
    <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/consequences/sleep-and-disease-risk"><span class="s4">higher risk</span></a> of developing chronic diseases. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 
    <a href="http://sleepdisorders.sleepfoundation.org/chapter-2-insomnia/what-is-insomnia/"><span class="s4">30-40 percent</span></a> of American adults report that they have had symptoms of insomnia within the last 12 months, and 10-15 percent of adults claim to have chronic insomnia.
